# EmotionalClassification_2022.9
This project is the final project of online class from Pavlos Protopapas.
By completing this project, I became more familiar with the skills which I learned in the classes, such as Data preprocessing, Model building and result presenting:
- Using data augmentation method to enlarge dataset for reinforcing model. 
- Using confusion matrix could help us examining the accuracy of results more intuitively.
- Grad-cam shows that many of features in facial expression can influence the machineâ€™s judgement. Thus it is a challenge to significantly improve the accuracy of the model.

**Although it's a group project and I mainly overcome the data preprocessing part,actually I take part in every part of this task.**
